## Usage Instructions

3. Customize the database schema and data as needed for your music store application.

## Purpose
During the development of this project I encountered some difficulties because I didn't know much about SQL Server, but the truth is that I loved how it turned out. 
It helped me a lot to put into practice what I had learned in my database course and I really feel like I'm getting along very well with SQL. 
I hope you like it.
